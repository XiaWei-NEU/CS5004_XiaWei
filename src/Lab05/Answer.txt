1. Which parts of which files would have needed to be modified?
A: With the use of the PerimeterComparator class, we wouldn't need to modify any of the existing files (Circle.java, Rectangle.java, Triangle.java, Shape.java, AbstractShape.java).


2. If it were not for sharing code via AbstractShape.java, how many files would have needed modification (assuming you have concrete Shapes for Rectangle, Circle, and Triangle)?
A: If it were not for sharing code via AbstractShape.java, we would still need to modify two files: PerimeterComparator.java and the class where we use it (e.g., ShapeDemo.java).
